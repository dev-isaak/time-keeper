# Time Keeper

## What is Time Keeper?
Time Keeper aims to be an application suitable for both personal and business use.

On one hand, users with a personal account can clock in the hours worked on a specific project and generate reports that detail the total hours worked on each project, per month, per week, overtime hours, and more.

On the other hand, users with a business account can perform the same actions as those with personal accounts, with the added ability to interact with their company to request vacations, days off, submit justifications, and so on.

The company's admin user can view all their employees, monitor their clock-ins for the day, track the hours they work, and interact with them for tasks such as approving vacation requests, among other things.

As of now, Time Keeper is in a web version with plans to create a mobile version in the future.
